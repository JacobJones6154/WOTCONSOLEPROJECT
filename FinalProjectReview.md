 * Planning \.
   * Here is my initial wireframe design of the home landing page. I wanted several things on the home page. Since i had designed this so early on, I didnt know exactly what I would be able to do as a final output so it was wishful thinking. All of my initial designs was me just running through my head, what I thought would be best and most efficient at the time. 
   ![Home Page](https://github.com/JacobJones6154/WOTCONSOLEPROJECT/blob/master/Assets/Home%20page.PNG) \.
 * Analysis \.
   * For the analysis I tried to do some market research of current applications that do similar functions to what I wanted. I tried to take the pros from each that I liked and ditch what I didnt like \.
 * Design \.
    * I used online tools to help design my wireframes and develop the flow I thought was useful, then I moved onto Prototypes with an online tool as well. This was all very useful in giving me ideas for how to layout my application\.
 * Implementation \.
    * Once I began to get down to the nitty gritty of the application, I realized designing a mobile first application wasnt in the best interest to the user to see my vision. Also, going through with my skill level, I changed the application significantly to match my talents as well as improve the userability of the site. I no longer had page after page to click through to get to a single tank but now I fell that it is a smoother process to the end goal. Some things are still being developed as of writing, namely the Compare page has yet to be fully created\. 
 * Testing \.
 * Maintenance \.
