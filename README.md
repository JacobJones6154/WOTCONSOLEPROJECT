## <div align="center">INSPIRATION</div>
[(back to top)](#table-of-contents)

I gained inspiration for this application because all too often i found myself on the couch playing the video game and trying to find the statistics for certain tanks, and the current options available were not very user friendly or helpful. 

## <div align="center">Concept</div>
[(back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The idea of this project is to create a simple, user friendly tool to compare tanks from the World Of Tanks video game. I want this app to be extremely easy to use while sitting on the couch in between games. I want it to be aesthetically appealing and functional.
