## <div align="center">INSPIRATION</div>
[(back to top)](#table-of-contents)

I gained inspiration for this application because all too often i found myself on the couch playing the video game and trying to find the statistics for certain tanks, and the current options available were not very user friendly or helpful. 

## <div align="center">Concept</div>
[(back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The idea of this project is to create a simple, user friendly tool to compare tanks from the World Of Tanks video game. I want this app to be extremely easy to use while sitting on the couch in between games. I want it to be aesthetically appealing and functional.

## THESE ARE INITIAL DRAFTS

The Home Page would be screen with links to the different features of the site, as well as a few coverflow tools allowing the user to select their options.

The Countries Page is where the user is directed to when they click on the countries tab. On this page a user can swipe through the different nations available and make thier selection.

The Tank Classes Page will display the five different tank classes that a user can choose from and the user can choose the class they are looking for and be directed to the Class Page.

The Class Page will display two cover flow options, the first will allow the user to select tier 1-10, or all tiers. And the second coverflow will display the results based on the selection of the first cover flow. For instance, if the user chooses tier one, ALL tier one tanks of that specific class will be displayed.

The Country Page will have a cover flow choice for each of the five specific tank class. Tanks will be displayed in order from lowest tier to highest. A user can choose the tank they wish to view tank description on from here.

The Tank Description Page will display the chosen tank, the nation, the class, and the tier. Below that will display a table with tank attributes and their corresponding characteristics.

The Compare Page allows a user to choose up to three tanks to compare statistics. Once the add feature is clicked on, the user will be directed to the Country page, then the Tank Class page, and finally the Class page to make their selection. Once they make their first selection, they are directed back to the Compare page to add another tank. This process repeats until at least two tanks are selected. Once the user is ready to compare attributes, they will click on the Battle button and be directed to the Tank Comparison page.

The Tank Comparison Page will display a table with attributes and values. Each value column will have a header specifying which tank corresponds to that specific column.
